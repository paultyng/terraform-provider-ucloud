# ucloud_db_instance

Provides a Database instance resource.

~> **Note**  Please do confirm if any task pending submission before reset your password, since the password reset will take effect immediately. In addition, if you try to update the property `parameter_group` which requires restarting the db instance, you must set `allow_stopping_for_update` to `true` in your config to allows Terraform to restart the instance to update its property. 

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Query availability zone
data "ucloud_zones" "default" {
}

# Create database instance
resource "ucloud_db_instance" "master" {
  name              = "tf-example-db"
  instance_storage  = 20
  instance_type     = "mysql-ha-1"
  engine            = "mysql"
  engine_version    = "5.7"
  password          = "2018_dbInstance"
}
```
## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `availability_zone` - (Required, ForceNew) Availability zone where database instance is located. Such as: "cn-bj2-02". You may refer to [list of availability zone](https://docs.ucloud.cn/api/summary/regionlist)

    - 500GB if the memory chosen is equal or less than 6GB;
    - 1000GB if the memory chosen is from 8 to 16GB;
    - 2000GB if the memory chosen is 24GB or 32GB;
    - 3500GB if the memory chosen is 48GB or 64GB;
    - 4500GB if the memory chosen is equal or more than 96GB;
* `instance_type` - (Required) The type of database instance, please visit the [instance type table](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/ucloud/appendix/db_instance_type.html).

- - -

* `standby_zone` - (Optional, ForceNew) Availability zone where the standby database instance is located for the high availability database instance with multiple zone; The disaster recovery of data center can be activated by switching to the standby database instance for the high availability database instance.
* `password` - (Optional) The password for the database instance which should have 8-30 characters. It must contain at least 3 items of Capital letters, small letter, numbers and special characters. The special characters include `-_`. If not specified, terraform will auto-generate a password.

* `allow_stopping_for_update` - (Optional) If you try to update the property `parameter_group` which requires restarting the db instance, you must set `allow_stopping_for_update` to `true` in your config to allows Terraform to restart the instance to update its property.

### Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 mins) Used when launching the db instance (until it reaches the initial `Running` state)
* `update` - (Defaults to 20 mins) Used when updating the arguments of the db instance if necessary  - e.g. when changing `instance_storage`
* `delete` - (Defaults to 10 mins) Used when terminating the db instance

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the resource db instance.
* `status` - Specifies the status of database, possible values are: `Init`, `Fail`, `Starting`, `Running`, `Shutdown`, `Shutoff`, `Delete`, `Upgrading`, `Promoting`, `Recovering` and `Recover fail`.
* `private_ip` - The private IP address assigned to the database instance.
